The given code is a temperature converter program written in C language. It allows the user to convert temperature values between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. The program uses switch statements and functions to handle different temperature conversions and user inputs.

This is a C program for a temperature converter. It allows the user to convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperatures. The program uses functions to handle each conversion type, and a switch statement to determine which conversion function to call based on the user's input.

The program starts by displaying a welcome message and prompting the user to select which temperature they want to convert. The user can choose between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

Once the user selects a temperature, the program prompts them to choose the conversion type, such as Fahrenheit to Celsius or Celsius to Kelvin. The user enters their selection, and the program calls the appropriate conversion function.

Each conversion function prompts the user to enter the temperature value they want to convert and then performs the necessary calculations to convert the temperature. The converted temperature is then displayed to the user.

After displaying the converted temperature, the program prompts the user if they want to continue using the system. If the user chooses to continue, the program returns to the temperature selection menu. If the user chooses to exit, the program displays a thank you message and exits.
